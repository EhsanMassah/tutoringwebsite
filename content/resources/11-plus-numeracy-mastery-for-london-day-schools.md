### What top London schools really test

Selective day schools deliberately hop between arithmetic fluency, multi-step logic and pattern recognition to see how pupils persevere under time pressure. The maths questions are rarely alien, but the switching speed is. Parents who create micro-routines for each skill tend to see calmer, more confident performances.

### Daily numeracy rhythm

- **Morning:** 10 minute CEM-style mental arithmetic routine (I like Schofield & Sims Mental Maths). Keep score visibly so children can see momentum build.  
- **After school:** Logic puzzle or non-verbal reasoning board that stays playful — ThinkFun Rush Hour or the David Walliams 11+ cards both work.  
- **Weekend:** Full timed section pulled from recent consortium papers followed by a “why the trap worked” breakdown.  

### Weekly structure for Years 5–6

1. **Monday diagnostics** – One focused paper section to spotlight weak sub-topics. Note the question numbers in a “redo later” list.  
2. **Wednesday mastery block** – 45 minutes on just two microskills (for example, fractions of quantities + code-breaking sequences).  
3. **Friday reasoning lab** – Mix of lateral-thinking games and interview-style prompts to keep verbal agility high.  
4. **Sunday dress rehearsal** – Sit the student at a cleared table, run a full paper, then mark using coloured pens so they visualise method marks.  

### Parental checkpoints

- Use a **calm, factual script** when asking about mistakes: “Which step cost you most time?” rather than “Why did you miss that?”.  
- Track slip-ups inside a shared Google Sheet so I can address them in our next lesson.  
- Rotate **reward choices** (baking, trip to Waterstones, extra park time) when your child hits three consecutive accuracy targets.  

### Recommended resources

| Goal | Resource | How we use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arithmetic speed | Bond Times Tables app | Quick wins during school runs |
| Reasoning breadth | GL Assessment practice papers | Alternate versions weekly so nothing feels “over memorised” |
| Interview flow | Family “press conference” cards | Parents ask, siblings record responses to build poise |

### When to escalate support

- Accuracy flat-lines below 75% for two consecutive months.  
- Timings dramatically worsen once problem-solving or spatial tasks appear.  
- Your child shows stress signals (clenched jaw, perfectionism, sudden “I can’t” statements).  

In those moments parents benefit from a tailored plan: tighter mock schedules, curated question banks and interview rehearsal loops. Use the [contact form](/contact) to request a Chelsea/South Kensington 11+ briefing — I’ll reply within one working day with next steps.
