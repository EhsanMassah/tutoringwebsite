#### Daily numeracy rhythm

- **Morning:** 10 minute CEM mental arithmetic routine.  
- **After school:** Logic puzzle or non-verbal reasoning board to keep it playful.  
- **Weekend:** Full timed section with review of “why the trap worked.”  

Combine with the mock interview prompts I share so responses stay fluid under pressure.
