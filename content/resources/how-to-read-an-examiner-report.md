### Step 1: Skim smartly

Start with the examiner’s overview paragraphs and highlight every sentence beginning with “most candidates” or “common error.” These signal the high-yield fixes. Ignore the historical commentary for now; parents only need actionable intelligence.

### Step 2: Build a response matrix

| Report wording | Translation | Action in tutorials |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “Candidates often omitted units” | Method marks lost through haste | Practise final-line checks using my 4-beat cadence |
| “Solutions lacked structure” | Workings unreadable under pressure | Rehearse with A3 paper + colour coding |
| “Few linked calculus to context” | Students memorised steps but not implications | Run modelling drills tied to London transport data |

Parents can add this matrix to a shared Google Doc so we both track the same weaknesses.

### Step 3: Create the checklist

- Convert every highlighted issue into a checkbox using the format: “Paper 1 Q6 – forgot to justify inequality sign.”  
- Organise checklists by exam section so they align with the student’s revision timetable.  
- Review them weekly and celebrate when we tick off recurring issues.  

### Step 4: Compare scripts to mark schemes

Sit with your child and look at an actual response (either their mock or a sample script). Then ask:

1. “Where would the examiner award the first method mark?”  
2. “What phrase needs to appear to earn the final communication mark?”  
3. “Which calculator or diagram step would reassure the marker I know the context?”  

Understanding how marks stack prevents careless half-credit losses.

### Bonus: share intel with tutors

Once you’ve highlighted the sections relevant to your child, send them to me via email or [contact form](/contact). I’ll spin the notes into bespoke drills, voiceover explanations and calm scripts you can use at home.

When parents and tutors treat examiner reports as a joint briefing document, students feel less isolated and more in control of what examiners really want.
