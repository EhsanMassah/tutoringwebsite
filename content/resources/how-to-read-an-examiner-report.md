Key actions:

- Highlight every “most candidates failed to…” phrase — that’s where we focus lesson drills.  
- Convert each comment into a precise checklist item inside the exam journal we update weekly.  
- Compare scripts with official mark schemes to understand how the examiner awards each method mark.  

This transforms a dense PDF into a step-by-step upgrade plan.
