#### Evening structure that works

1. 20 minute brain-dump to clear loose ends.  
2. 45 minute focused block with retrieval prompts.  
3. Short debrief on what still feels “muddy” to surface for the next lesson.  

Pair this with light exercise or a walk to decompress. Confidence increases when the nervous system is calm.
