### Evening structure that works

1. **20 minute brain-dump** to clear loose ends. Use A3 paper, write everything swirling in their head, then circle the items we can solve tomorrow.  
2. **45 minute focused block** with retrieval prompts and exam timers. Keep siblings away and pre-arrange snacks so there’s zero mid-session negotiation.  
3. **Short debrief** on what still feels “muddy” to surface for the next lesson or my next tutoring session.  

Pair this with light exercise or a walk to decompress. Confidence increases when the nervous system is calm.

### Parent scripts for tricky conversations

- *Motivation dip*: “I can see today was draining. Let’s pick one topic to steady and park the rest for tomorrow.”  
- *Overwhelm*: “Would it help if I email Ehsan with the specific questions worrying you so he can prioritise them next lesson?”  
- *Perfectionism*: “Mocks are rehearsals. We learn what the paper wants; then we adapt the plan.”  

### Weekly rhythm

| Day | Parent action | Student focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | Confirm the week’s timetable and travel commitments. | Retrieval practice on two subjects only. |
| Wednesday | Check sleep/wellbeing; book a short activity break (yoga, swim). | Timed paper segment with accuracy audit. |
| Friday | Quiet review conversation, 10 minutes max. | Finish any outstanding flashcards, then rest. |
| Sunday | Prepare uniform, food, transport to remove Monday friction. | Long-form essay or problem paper. |

### Track energy, not just marks

I ask parents to rate evening energy 1–5 in a shared sheet. If ratings slump below 3 for several days, we pause heavy workloads and focus on routine resets, nutrition and stress tools before returning to academics.

### When to bring in extra help

- Sleep broken for more than three nights.  
- Emotional spikes: tears, anger, shutdowns.  
- Grades diverge between teacher feedback and mock results.  

Send me a direct note with the school, exam board and mock timetable via the [contact page](/contact). I’ll map out a targeted plan for your teenager and, if needed, coordinate with school staff so everyone gives the same calm message.
