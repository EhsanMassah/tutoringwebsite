Pre-lab briefing tips:

- Map apparatus setup the night before and photograph it — we use the image to speed through the first 10 minutes.  
- Write a “likely errors” list to reference when drafting evaluation statements.  
- Keep a mini codebook of data booklet references; it saves precious seconds when the timer is running.  

Confidence comes from rehearsing the choreography long before stepping into the lab.
