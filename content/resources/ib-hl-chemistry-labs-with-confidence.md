### Pre-lab briefing tips

- Map apparatus setup the night before and photograph it — we use the image to speed through the first 10 minutes.  
- Write a “likely errors” list to reference when drafting evaluation statements.  
- Keep a mini codebook of data booklet references; it saves precious seconds when the timer is running.  
- Double-check risk assessments align with the specific lab (Imperial, school basement, home setup) because technicians often tweak processes.  

Confidence comes from rehearsing the choreography long before stepping into the lab.

### During the experiment

| Stage | Student habit | Parent support |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Setup | Lay out apparatus in left-to-right order to reduce fumbles. | Help print the teacher’s instructions in large type to avoid mid-lab scrolling. |
| Data capture | Record every observation immediately, even “obvious” ones. | Encourage your child to narrate steps aloud during dry runs at home. |
| Contingencies | Have spare glassware and pipette tips ready. | If tests happen at home, prep backups the night before so nothing derails the session. |

### IA reflection flow

1. **Describe** – two concise sentences about what happened vs. the plan.  
2. **Interpret** – link the anomaly to chemical principles (“heat loss via conduction lowered rate”).  
3. **Improve** – propose a realistic tweak they could implement in the school lab.  

Parents can prompt each stage over dinner instead of asking, “How did the lab go?”

### Make the data booklet your ally

Teach students to bookmark key sections with sticky tabs labelled “Thermo,” “Acid-base,” “Redox.” During tutoring sessions we rehearse flipping to the right table blindfolded-style so it becomes muscle memory.

### Timeline reminders

- Draft lab plans at least two weeks before school deadlines.  
- Schedule one rehearsal with me (video call works) to pressure-test timings.  
- Leave 48 hours between experiment day and writing the evaluation so emotions settle and the analysis becomes measured.  

### When to reach out

If your teenager keeps re-running experiments, feels lost writing the evaluation, or struggles to articulate uncertainties, we can co-create a personalised IA template. Share the brief via the [contact page](/contact) and I’ll respond with a step-by-step plan tailored to the lab facilities available to Chelsea/Kensington families.
