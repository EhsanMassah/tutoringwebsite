### What this blueprint covers

- Weekly objectives built around the Edexcel and AQA higher tier modules.  
- Retrieval practice cards and mini whiteboard drills I use during lessons.  
- Sample dialogue for calm, confidence-building parent check-ins.  
- Nutrition, sleep and travel adjustments relevant to Chelsea day schools.

### Baseline week: set expectations

1. **Audit knowledge** – Use the most recent school paper or my diagnostic deck and log every misconception in one sheet.  
2. **Agree rhythms** – Two 45-minute study blocks on weekdays, one 90-minute block at the weekend. Add them to a shared calendar so clashes disappear.  
3. **Create frictionless spaces** – Clear maths-specific shelves: calculator, A3 paper, coloured pens, spare protractors, mini whiteboards.  

### Sample 6-week sprint

| Week | Core focus | Parent action | Resources |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Algebra foundations (simultaneous equations, inequality graphing) | Ask for “teach-back” explanations; it reveals logic gaps. | Pearson Skills Boost booklets, Dr Frost tasks |
| 2 | Geometry + bearings | Schedule a local field walk with compass practice along the Thames or Battersea Park. | Corbett Maths bearings pack |
| 3 | Statistics & probability | Host a “family quiz night” where the pupil writes cumulative frequency questions. | AQA specimen sets |
| 4 | Advanced number (surds, indices) | Pair homework with 10-minute flashcard bursts. | Quizlet deck I provide |
| 5 | Mixed problem solving | Run two timed papers this week; mark one together using model solutions. | Edexcel June 2023 paper |
| 6 | Exam rehearsal | Focus on stamina: two papers back-to-back with 20-minute rest, replicating real conditions. | School-provided mocks |

### Script for constructive check-ins

- **Observe**: “I noticed the algebra question took 6 minutes — what slowed you down?”  
- **Offer help**: “Would it help if I set up the whiteboard so you can rehearse the steps aloud before the next paper?”  
- **Reinforce calm**: “Remember the goal is steady improvement, not perfection tonight.”  

### Keep phone notifications under control

Set Do Not Disturb windows on both parent and student devices during revision blocks. Families often forget that WhatsApp pings from school groups are the biggest focus killer.

### Nutrition and movement

- Make a **30-minute pre-study walk** around Chelsea Embankment or Hyde Park a habit; oxygen + daylight sharpen concentration.  
- Prep a simple snack plate (Greek yoghurt, berries, handful of nuts) before sessions so there’s no mid-block rummaging.  

### When to request extra guidance

If mocks hover under grade 7 despite heavy effort, or anxiety spikes around non-calculator papers, book a rapid audit with me. I’ll build a bespoke workbook and pacing plan around your child’s latest scripts — [send a note](/contact) with the school name and exam board and I’ll reply with the exact next steps for Chelsea families.
