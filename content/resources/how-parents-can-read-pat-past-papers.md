### Why parent analysis helps

PAT questions blend A-level Physics and Maths but reward calm reasoning more than exotic knowledge. When parents understand the shape of each paper, you can prompt your child to revisit the right techniques instead of urging them to “just do more past papers.”

### 30-minute review framework

1. **Scan the paper** – note the mix of short vs. long questions and whether Maths or Physics dominates that year.  
2. **Choose three questions** that mirror your child’s weak spots.  
3. **Use the mark scheme** to see exactly how many marks come from setup vs. algebra vs. final reasoning.  
4. **Log insights** in a shared tracker so I can align tutorials with what you’re seeing at home.  

### Parent prompting scripts

- “Which physical principle unlocks this question?”  
- “Where could the examiner award the first method mark?”  
- “Can you sketch the situation before touching the algebra?”  

Avoid jumping to solutions; stay curious and encourage your student to narrate their thinking.

### Error taxonomy

| Error type | How to spot it | Parent intervention |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptual | Student mislabels forces or misapplies energy conservation | Ask them to restate the underlying law in plain English |
| Algebraic | Correct setup but slips solving simultaneous equations/integration | Encourage slow, line-by-line rewriting on a whiteboard |
| Time pressure | Abandons multi-mark questions halfway | Practise 10-minute sprints with a timer and review pacing |

### Build a rotation schedule

Week 1 focuses on Sections A (shorts) with heavy emphasis on units and estimation. Week 2 hits long-form mechanics problems. Week 3 combines both under timed conditions. Rotating themes prevents burnout and ensures coverage of the entire specification.

### Data to share with me

- Papers attempted and scores above/below the 60s benchmark.  
- Questions where reasoning felt “foggy.”  
- Any graph or diagram sketches your child struggles to translate into equations.  

Send the tracker via email or the [contact page](/contact); I’ll layer on bespoke drills, narrated walkthroughs and, if useful, ESAT crossover practice so your teenager feels prepared for every Cambridge and Oxford variant.
