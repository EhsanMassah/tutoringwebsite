Focus anchors:

- Neutral wall in front of the desk — the fewer visual prompts the better.  
- Task light angled away from the screen to reduce glare and eye fatigue.  
- Grab tray for post-it questions so they can be captured then covered at the end of the session.  

Small tweaks like these remove “micro friction” and keep the mind fresh for higher-order reasoning.
