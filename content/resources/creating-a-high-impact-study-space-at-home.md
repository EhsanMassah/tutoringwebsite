### Step 1: Zone the room

- **Face the wall:** Position the desk toward a neutral wall instead of a window to limit visual stimuli.  
- **Create a lightweight divider:** In open-plan flats, a folding screen or tall bookcase instantly signals “study mode” without major renovations.  
- **Lighting:** Use a task lamp angled away from screens to avoid glare and headaches; Philips Hue bulbs let you shift from cool focus light to warm wind-down hues afterwards.  

### Step 2: Organise tools parents care about

- **Grab tray system:** One tray for “questions to ask Ehsan,” one for “completed work to file.” Students feel less overwhelmed when every sheet has a destination.  
- **Cable discipline:** Stick-on cable clips keep chargers and calculators ready. Less time hunting = more mental bandwidth for maths proofs.  
- **Scent/audio cues:** A subtle diffuser or low-volume instrumental playlist signals the brain it’s time to focus. Consistency matters more than the brand.  

### Step 3: Manage digital distractions

1. Install app-blockers (Opal, Freedom) on laptops and phones.  
2. Set router-level schedules if siblings keep streaming near the workspace.  
3. Store phones in a charging drawer outside the line of sight; even upside-down phones leak attention.  

### Parent-friendly maintenance routine

- Sunday evening reset: wipe down desks, refill stationery, print fresh exam papers.  
- Midweek micro-clean: 5-minute tidy right after dinner keeps the area welcoming.  
- Monthly purge: recycle outdated notes, archive key resources in labelled wallets.  

### Quick wins for small London flats

- Use **wall-mounted pegboards** for calculators, compasses and headphones to free desk space.  
- Swap bulky desk chairs for ergonomic kneeling stools that tuck away after sessions.  
- Install a **magnetic whiteboard** on the back of a wardrobe door; it becomes the perfect scratch space for maths without dominating the room.  

### When the environment still feels fraught

If your teenager avoids the space or spirals into perfectionism, pair these physical tweaks with coaching. I can audit their setup during an online call and produce a personalised “focus flow” guide referencing the exact layout of your Chelsea/Kensington home.
