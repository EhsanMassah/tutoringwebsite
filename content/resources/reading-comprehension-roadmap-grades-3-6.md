### The core problem parents describe

- “She can read the words but can’t tell me what happened.”  
- “He rushes and guesses; the marks disappear on inference questions.”  
- “She freezes on longer texts and says, ‘I don’t get it.’”  

This roadmap tackles those exact pain points with a simple weekly rhythm, tutor-backed routines and scripts you can use tonight.

### Week 1: Reset the environment and expectations

- **Swap speed for clarity:** Tell your child, “Our goal this week is to slow down and prove answers with the text.”  
- **Shrink text length:** Start with 2–3 short paragraphs so the brain isn’t overloaded.  
- **Read out loud together:** Alternate sentences. When you read, model pausing at commas and bolding important words with your voice.  
- **Set a calm pace:** 15–20 focused minutes, four times a week, is better than one long, tense session.  

### Week 2: Build “find and prove” habits

1. **Finger tracking for evidence:** As they answer, have them point to the exact sentence. If they can’t point, they’re guessing.  
2. **Colour code:** Highlight where the answer comes from (yellow for literal, green for inference).  
3. **Answer frames:** Teach them to start answers with “The text says…” to force a reference back.  
4. **Parent script:** “Show me the sentence that made you think that. Let’s underline it together.”  

### Week 3: Decode question types (so they stop guessing)

- **Who/What/Where:** Look for names, numbers, places; skim first, then hunt.  
- **Why/How:** Ask, “What is the author trying to make me feel or understand?”  
- **Vocabulary in context:** Cover the word, read the sentence without it, guess meaning from clues, then check with a dictionary.  
- **Two-step inference:** (a) What is literally said? (b) What must be true because of that?  

### Week 4: Stamina without stress

- **Chunk long passages:** Fold the page to show only one paragraph at a time.  
- **Micro-pauses:** 10-second eye breaks between paragraphs reduce sloppy errors.  
- **Timer discipline:** 8–10 minutes per page is fine at this age; speed comes after accuracy.  
- **Energy check:** If posture slumps or sighs begin, stop at the next paragraph boundary and end on a win.  

### Weekly rhythm parents can keep

| Day | Focus | Parent prompt |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mon | Short fiction extract | “Let’s find the sentence that proves your answer.” |
| Wed | Non-fiction (science/news) | “Underline the clue that explains why this happened.” |
| Fri | Vocabulary & inference mini-drill | “What else could this word mean? What tells you?” |
| Sun | Review & praise | “This week you improved at ___. Next week we’ll keep that and add ___.” |

### Fast fixes for common blocks

- **Rushing:** Cover answer options; ask them to summarise the paragraph in 10 words first.  
- **Fear of being wrong:** Offer two possible answers yourself, one incorrect; let them critique you.  
- **Low confidence:** Start with texts one year below current level to rebuild wins, then step up.  
- **Distracted environment:** Sit shoulder-to-shoulder, remove phones, and keep a scrap paper for doodling fidgets.  

### Make it relevant (so they care)

- Choose texts that match their interests: football match reports, animal fact files, short mysteries.  
- Let them teach you back: “Explain this paragraph to me like I’m in Year 3.” Teaching cements understanding.  
- Link to real life: “This instruction is like your Lego build — what happens if we skip step 3?”  

### Parent-friendly tools

- **Question stems list** on the fridge: “What changed from start to end?”, “How is ___ feeling? What words show that?”, “What does the writer want you to believe?”  
- **Evidence bookmarks:** A simple sticky note that says “Find it. Underline it. Answer it.”  
- **Timer + highlighters:** Set a visible 10-minute timer and pre-select two highlighter colours to avoid faffing.  

### When to get targeted tutoring

- Comprehension scores stuck below expected despite consistent practice.  
- Avoidance or tears around longer texts.  
- Big gap between decoding (can read aloud fine) and understanding (can’t explain meaning).  

If that sounds familiar, I can run a 30-minute diagnostic, show your child the “find and prove” method, and design a personalised 4-week plan you can follow at home. [Book a consult](/contact) and mention your child’s year group and school so I can prep relevant texts.

### Quick FAQ for parents

- **How long should answers be?** 1–2 sentences that cite the text are enough. Quality beats length.  
- **Do audiobooks count?** Yes, as long as you pause to ask “What just happened?” and “Why did that character do that?” Listening builds vocabulary and understanding.  
- **What about ESL learners?** Pre-teach 3–5 key words before reading. Visuals help. Keep texts slightly easier while vocabulary catches up.  
- **How do we prepare for SATs/11+?** Nail evidence-hunting first, then introduce timed practice with official-style questions. I can supply age-appropriate past paper extracts on request.  

### Keep the loop closed

Each Sunday, jot three notes: (1) What texts worked best, (2) Which question type still causes wobbles, (3) What praise landed. Bring these into our tutoring sessions so I can adjust materials and keep confidence rising without adding stress at home.
