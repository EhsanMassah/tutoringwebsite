## What interviewers are checking

- **How you think out loud:** They want your reasoning pathway, not just the final answer.
- **Problem-solving under constraint:** Can you simplify, approximate, or model quickly?
- **Fluency with first principles:** Algebra, calculus, mechanics, electricity, vectors, probability.
- **Resilience:** Handling curveballs, regrouping after a dead end, and using hints effectively.

## Physics themes to rehearse

- **Mechanics:** projectile motion with/without air resistance, circular motion, energy vs. force approaches.  
- **Electricity:** series/parallel reasoning, potential dividers, RC time constants.  
- **Waves:** interference conditions, Doppler shifts, boundary reflections.  
- **Thermo & gases:** ideal gas approximations, energy distributions, simple cycles.  
- **Estimation:** Fermi problems (e.g., “How many photons hit a solar panel per second?”).

## Maths themes to rehearse

- **Functions & graphs:** sketching with asymptotes/turning points; odd/even; periodicity.  
- **Calculus:** optimisation, related rates, series approximations, integration tricks.  
- **Algebra:** inequalities, sequences/series, binomial expansions, functional equations.  
- **Vectors/geometry:** projections, shortest distance, locus questions.  
- **Probability/combinatorics:** conditional probability, expected value with constraints.

## Past-paper strategy (PAT/ESAT/MAT/NSAA/STEP)

- **PAT/ESAT/NSAA:** practise mixed sections; focus on rapid diagramming and units.  
- **MAT:** practise full solutions with clear exposition—show elegance, not just correctness.  
- **STEP:** timebox by question; learn when to pivot if algebra explodes.  
- **Debrief:** After each paper, write three bullets: (a) fastest win, (b) biggest trap, (c) a cleaner alternative method.

## Day-before checklist

- Light review of your own solutions, not new papers.  
- Write a one-page cheatsheet of heuristics and common pitfalls (units, sign errors, forgetting constraints).  
- Sleep, hydration, and a test of your mic/camera if online.

## How I can help

- Run structured mock interviews with timed prompts, guided hints, and post-review of your reasoning.  
- Build a personalised problem pack targeting your weak themes (mechanics/graphs/probability).  
- Calibrate your “thinking aloud” style so it’s clear, concise, and confident under pressure.
