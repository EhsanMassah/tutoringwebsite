### Interview week overview

Most senior schools run interviews, assessments and tours within five intense days. Parents who map the week upfront keep energy steady and avoid panic. Build your plan around rest, short rehearsals and light cultural outings that feed curiosity rather than cramming.

### Daily blueprint

| Day | Morning | Afternoon | Evening parent action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monday | 30-minute confidence warm-up (storytelling, mental maths) | School tour + first interview | Debrief using “What felt strong? What needs polishing?” |
| Tuesday | Mock interview with me (in person or video) focused on academic flair | Quiet reading/walk in Hyde Park | Draft thank-you email if school encourages it |
| Wednesday | Pastoral question practice (“How do you contribute to school life?”) | Creative pursuit (museum visit, music practice) | Early night + visualisation exercise |
| Thursday | Logic and problem-solving drills (I tailor puzzles to each school) | Stretch/flexibility session to release nerves | Parent reminder: big picture, not perfection |
| Friday | Light recap only, then celebratory lunch after final interview | Rest | Family reflection + next steps talk |

### Parent scripts

- **Opening pep talk:** “Interviews are conversations. Let’s focus on curiosity and kindness; the rest follows.”  
- **Post-interview processing:** “Tell me one question you enjoyed and one you’d like to revisit. We’ll share the second with Ehsan.”  
- **Managing disappointment:** “Progress is measured across the entire week, not a single question. We adapt and keep going.”  

### Micro-rehearsals

1. **Academic spark:** Ask your child to explain a recent experiment or book using analogies. Record and replay to tweak clarity.  
2. **Ethos fit:** Practise responses to “How do you handle setbacks?” using real stories from school clubs.  
3. **Current affairs:** Create a family “headline bowl” and pull a topic to discuss over dinner.  

### Logistics checklist

- Confirm travel times between Chelsea homes and each school; buffer 30 minutes for traffic.  
- Prepare interview outfits the night before and pack water/snacks that won’t stain.  
- Keep copies of reports, certificates and portfolio items in a single wallet.  

### When to involve me

- Your child freezes on open-ended questions.  
- Interviewers flagged a gap (e.g., STEM depth or extracurricular breadth).  
- Parents want a “final rehearsal” with verbal and non-verbal feedback.
